## What is this repository?
In this repository I manage my javascript files for the MorePurpleMoreBetter(MPMB) Character Sheet PDF.
If my group(s) require(s) scripts that aren't available online I sometimes make them myself.

## Can I use these for myself and/or my (online) groups?
Of course! 

## Do you do requests?
**_Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime._**

I highly suggest you learn to make them yourself, as it lets you make whatever fits your specific needs.
MPMB has a Subreddit and Discord with people that can (most likely) answer any programming questions you might have.

## The script isn't working for me, how come?
- The scripts are MPMB version sensitive, if you run into errors, try a different sheet version first (I tested my sheets in version 13.1.7).
- MPMB's PDF, to my understanding, only works with Adobe Acrobat, so make sure you're using that.

## Your script doesn't match its supposed source?
Sometimes my sources update their material. I don't always do that.

## Disclaimer
I'm not the most dedicated Github user and my presence is infrequent and in bursts. It is unlikely to see any fast reponses from me here.
